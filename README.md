This code was created to generate `.jpg` images with bounding box(es) (rectangle only) from directory that contains JSON file(s) created by [LabelMe](https://github.com/LabelMe/labelme)

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Install `requirements.txt`

        pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    OR

        pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Open `draw_boxes.py`
2. Config following settings
    
    ```python
        # General setting 
        # this directory must contain json of labelme data (original image is optional)
        PATH_TO_JSONS = "img"
        PATH_TO_SAVE_IMG = "labeled_img"  # path to save image with bounding box

       # Bounding box setting 
        BOX_COLOR = (0, 0, 255)  # (B,G,R)
        BOX_THICKNESS = 2  # in pixel
    ```  
    > **NOTE:** Path specify in `PATH_TO_JSONS` must contain JSONS file(s) generated by [LabelMe](https://github.com/LabelMe/labelme)
